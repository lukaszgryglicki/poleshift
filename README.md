# poleshift
Allows to choose earth map image (or any other) and regenerate it with North/South poles shifted

# Config

Looking from up to the North Pole.

(lon 0, lat 0) is to the right: (1, 0, 0).

(lon 90, lat 0) is to the front: (0, 1, 0).

(lon +/-180, lat 0) is to the left: (-1, 0, 0).

(lon -90, lat 0) is to the back: (0, -1, 0).

North Pole (lon ?, lat 90) is up: (0, 0, 1).

South Pole (lon ?, lat -90) is down: (0, 0, -1).

First rotation is clockwise by using Y axis which goes through (90, 0) and (-90, 0).

Second rotation is clockwise by using Z axis which goes through unrotated North and South poles.

# Usage

Provide either:
- 4 args: lon lat alpha beta
- 6 args: input_file alpha beta output_width output_height output_name

Use `DOUBLE=1` env variable to make x resultion double, to include wrapping 50% from the left and 50% from the right.

Use `DIRECTION="alpha_inc;beta_inc;n_frames"` to generate `n_fromes` output files (frame num prefix prepended) changing alpha and beta by `alpha_inc`, `beta_inc` each step.

# Generate images

- Use `images.sh` script to generate example rotation images for all 15 degrees rotations for alpha and beta angles

# Generate video

- Use `video.sh` script that will create final 3000 frames which means 120s (2 minutes) of 25 FPS movie with rotating poles, file is [here](https://github.com/lukaszgryglicki/poleshift/blob/master/video.mp4)
- It is also available on YouTube [here]().
